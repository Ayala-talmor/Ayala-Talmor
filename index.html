        <h2>My Work as a Product Manager</h2>
        <div class="work-content">
          <p>
            I recently started working at <strong>Dot Compliance</strong> as a student Product Manager. As I’m still learning the product, I find it exciting to explore the system with a critical eye and think about how to improve it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy coming up with new ideas, collaborating closely with designers, developers, and QA, and being part of a dynamic and fast-paced environment where there’s always more to learn and contribute.
          </p>
